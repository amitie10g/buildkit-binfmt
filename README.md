This repository exists solely to clone some Docker images (namely ``tonistiigi/binfmt`` and ``moby/buildkit``) from the **Docker Hub container registry** to **GitHub container registry** (**GitHub Packages**), in order to be used in my own **GitHub Actions** workflows avoiding exhausting the quota from Docker Hub. You may use them, too.
